# FUNDAMENTALS-OF-DATA-ANALYSIS-Project-2019
Programme Outline and Tasks: Tips Project

#### Importing the Dataset into Jupyter
To import a dataset into Jupyter, there are two main methods: 

Through uploading the data to your Jupyter notebook and call the data from a folder inside your respository

Through an url using the command = df = pd.read_csv ("url") and calling the df command after. This enables you to directly acccess the code for its original source. The data must be in its raw state to be imported. 

To do: 

To Download and import: 
    Tips Dataset - done 
 
Python Packages
    Seaborn
    Jupyter

Tasks:
30% - Description
    Create a git repository and make it available online that contains all of your work for this project
    Create a jupyter notement that descibes the dataset in 
        descriptive statistics
        plots to describe dataset

30% - Regression
    In Juptyer notebook, add a section that: 
        discusses and analyses the relationship between the total bill and tip amount
"Is there a relationship between the total bill and the tip amount"

40% - Analyse
    In Juptyer notebook, analysi relationships between variables (this can be all varioables or a subset)

To do: 
1 - README - ongoing
2. Summary of my work
3 - Instructions as to how to run the jupyter and web application
    Needs to be well laid out, clear and concise and easily understood and run.

4 - Jupyter Notebook - done
30% - Description
5. Create a git repository - done
6 - Descriptive Statistics
7 - Plots to describe the dataset
8 - Regression - Discuss and analyse whether there is a relaitonship between the total bill and tip amount - Good analysis of the relationship between the total bill with good explanations of the analysis
9 - Analyse the variables within the notebook
10 - Relationships between the variables
11 - Interesting relationships highlighted and discussed
